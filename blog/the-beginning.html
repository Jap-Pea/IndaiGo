          <h1>The Beginning</h1>
          <p>Where it all began...</p>
          <p>
            As a kid, I was obsessed with <strong>Pokémon&reg;</strong> on the
            <strong>Game Boy&reg;</strong>. Hours would disappear while I
            trained my team and explored those pixelated worlds.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the same time, I had a first-generation
            <strong>PlayStation&reg;</strong>, and I couldn't stop wondering -
            <em>why wasn't there a 3D version of Pokémon?</em> The idea of
            running around in a fully 3D world with creatures battling and
            interacting felt like magic waiting to happen.
          </p>
          <p>
            That thought stuck with me for years - the "what if" of combining
            those worlds.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, I've reached the point where I can actually build that spark
            into reality. What started as childhood curiosity is becoming the
            foundation of my journey into game development.

        <h2>Why I'm doing this</h2>
        <p>
          I'm aiming to learn it all from — <strong>HTML</strong>,
          <strong>JavaScript</strong>, <strong>C++</strong>, and building
          immersive experiences with <strong>Unreal Engine&reg;</strong>.
        </p>

        <h2>"IndaiGo"—what's the deal?</h2>
        <p>
          IndaiGo is my personal brand and umbrella for my projects. It's small
          now, but it's growing.
